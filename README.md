# Food_classifier_CSC311 (Everything Written from Scratch Using NumPy and Pandas)

This project is a food classification system developed as part of the CSC311 course. It aims to classify food items into predefined categories ['Pizza', 'Shawarma', 'Sushi'] using machine learning techniques. **All implementations were written from scratch using NumPy and Pandas.**

## Features
- Implementation of classification models
- Evaluation of model performance

## Models Explored
We experimented with the following models:
1. Decision Trees (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and simple decision trees )
2. Naive Bayes (from scratch with Numpy and Pandas)
3. Neural Networks (forward pass and backward pass written from scratch with Numpy and Pandas)
4. Naive Bayes Logits chained with Neural Networks
5. Decision Trees initialized with Naive Bayes outputs logits

## Final Results
From our final report, the best-performing model achieved:
- **Accuracy: 91%**

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Required libraries listed in `requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies.
3. Run the training script to train the model.
4. Use the trained model to classify food images.
